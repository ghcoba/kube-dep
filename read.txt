1. playbooks are in directory playbook/

2. before deplyment, you need setup following environment settings:
   . cluster inventory (inventories/dev/hosts, inventories/dev/host_vars/*, inventories/dev/group/vars/* )
   . cluster network configurations (roles/cluster-defaults/defaults/network.yml)
   . docker https_proxy setting (roles/cluster-defaults/defaults/network.yml)
   . prepare binary files according directory structure and file format (dep-data/bin-local/*)
   . change binary depploy file path and version according setting of the previous item 
     (in file roles/cluster-defaults/defaults/deploy-path.yml)
   . check kube-router settings in file (roles/cluster-defaults/defaults/kube-router-default-setting.yml)
   . check apiserver setting in file roles/create-kube-cluster-master/defaults/main.yml
   . check kubelet setting in file roles/create-kube-worker-node/defaults/main.yml

3. deploy and remove kubernetes cluster (including: kubernetes master nodes, etcd cluster, worker node)
   in kube-dep/ directory, 
   > type following command in command line to deploy kubernetes cluster:
     # ansible-playbook -i inventories/dev/hosts playbooks/deploy-cluster.yml
   > to remove created kubernetes cluster, type following command:
     # ansible-playbook -i inventories/dev/hosts playbooks/remove-deploy-cluster.yml

4. deploy record and data backups
   . backup files of cert used in deployment are stored in dep-data/cert-local/* (on ansible deploy machine)
   . backup files of kubeconfig used in deployment are stored in dep-data/kube-config-local/* (on ansible deploy machine)
   . during deployment, ansible deploy machine is used to create cert files and also as a cert file cache to store cert files.
     all generated .json .csr cert key and private key .pem files, which will be used or will be pupulated to cluster node, 
     are stored in /etc/cert-cache directory (on ansible deploy machine)
