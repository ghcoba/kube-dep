about create-etcd-cluster role

implement by using create-etcd-node -

  . check environment (if /etc/etcd not exist, exec following procedure. or skip )
  
  . create etcd user
  . create /etc/etcd directory
  . create etcd cert (copy cert from node-0 of cluster masters)
  . create etcd binary
  . create etcd systemd unit file
  . enable firewall rules for etcd traffic (2379/2380/4001-tcp traffic)
  . set ntp server and client for etcd cluster
  . enable etcd service and start service
  . create enviroment settings for etcdctl command-line (need reboot or start new bash environment)


todo:
  . ntp server and client setting for etcd cluster not yet finished.



---------

remark:
  1. nodes with etcdctl, ubectl, flanneld will need access rights for etcd.
      this role will create and setting etcd cluster only.
      other nodes need access rights to etcd will have to proceeed in its roles seperatly.
  2. 



command line to check etcd using etcdctl:
(following command line parameters works)

# etcdctl --ca-file=/etc/etcd/cert/etcd-ca.pem --cert-file=/etc/etcd/cert/etcd-client.pem --key-file=/etc/etcd/cert/etcd-client-key.pem --endpoints=https://10.0.0.121:2379 cluster-health
