Usage of kube-router:
      --advertise-cluster-ip             Add Cluster IP of the service to the RIB so that it gets advertises to the BGP peers.
      --advertise-external-ip            Add External IP of service to the RIB so that it gets advertised to the BGP peers.
      --advertise-loadbalancer-ip        Add LoadbBalancer IP of service status as set by the LB provider to the RIB so that it gets advertised to the BGP peers.
      --advertise-pod-cidr               Add Node's POD cidr to the RIB so that it gets advertised to the BGP peers. (default true)
      --bgp-graceful-restart             Enables the BGP Graceful Restart capability so that routes are preserved on unexpected restarts
      --cleanup-config                   Cleanup iptables rules, ipvs, ipset configuration and exit.
      --cluster-asn uint                 ASN number under which cluster nodes will run iBGP.
      --cluster-cidr string              CIDR range of pods in the cluster. It is used to identify traffic originating from and destinated to pods.
      --enable-ibgp                      Enables peering with nodes with the same ASN, if disabled will only peer with external BGP peers (default true)
      --enable-overlay                   When enable-overlay set to true, IP-in-IP tunneling is used for pod-to-pod networking across nodes in different subnets. When set to false no tunneling is used and routing infrastrcture is expected to route traffic for pod-to-pod networking across nodes in different subnets (default true)
      --enable-pod-egress                SNAT traffic from Pods to destinations outside the cluster. (default true)
      --enable-pprof                     Enables pprof for debugging performance and memory leak issues.
      --hairpin-mode                     Add iptable rules for every Service Endpoint to support hairpin traffic.
      --health-port uint16               Health check port, 0 = Disabled (default 20244)
  -h, --help                             Print usage information.
      --hostname-override string         Overrides the NodeName of the node. Set this if kube-router is unable to determine your NodeName automatically.
      --iptables-sync-period duration    The delay between iptables rule synchronizations (e.g. '5s', '1m'). Must be greater than 0. (default 5m0s)
      --ipvs-sync-period duration        The delay between ipvs config synchronizations (e.g. '5s', '1m', '2h22m'). Must be greater than 0. (default 5m0s)
      --kubeconfig string                Path to kubeconfig file with authorization information (the master location is set by the master flag).
      --masquerade-all                   SNAT all traffic to cluster IP/node port.
      --master string                    The address of the Kubernetes API server (overrides any value in kubeconfig).
      --metrics-path string              Prometheus metrics path (default "/metrics")
      --metrics-port uint16              Prometheus metrics port, (Default 0, Disabled)
      --nodeport-bindon-all-ip           For service of NodePort type create IPVS service that listens on all IP's of the node.
      --nodes-full-mesh                  Each node in the cluster will setup BGP peering with rest of the nodes. (default true)
      --peer-router-asns uints           ASN numbers of the BGP peer to which cluster nodes will advertise cluster ip and node's pod cidr. (default [])
      --peer-router-ips ipSlice          The ip address of the external router to which all nodes will peer and advertise the cluster ip and pod cidr's. (default [])
      --peer-router-multihop-ttl uint8   Enable eBGP multihop supports -- sets multihop-ttl. (Relevant only if ttl >= 2)
      --peer-router-passwords strings    Password for authenticating against the BGP peer defined with "--peer-router-ips".
      --routes-sync-period duration      The delay between route updates and advertisements (e.g. '5s', '1m', '2h22m'). Must be greater than 0. (default 5m0s)
      --run-firewall                     Enables Network Policy -- sets up iptables to provide ingress firewall for pods. (default true)
      --run-router                       Enables Pod Networking -- Advertises and learns the routes to Pods via iBGP. (default true)
      --run-service-proxy                Enables Service Proxy -- sets up IPVS for Kubernetes Services. (default true)
